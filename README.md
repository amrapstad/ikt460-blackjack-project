# How to use Docker

## First-time setup (Once per computer)

Run the following command from the root directory of the repository:

```bash
docker compose up
```

From here on if you are using VSCode you attach it to the container and open the folder called **/app (NOT /root).
You can **START and **STOP the container from Docker Desktop.
